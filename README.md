Abstract:\
\
This research presents a comprehensive comparative analysis between YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, focusing on their applicability for real-time object detection on the resource-constrained Raspberry Pi platform. Leveraging a curated tank dataset, the study employs Google Colab for model training due to computational limitations inherent to the Raspberry Pi. The investigation encompasses evaluations on original images as well as assessments of model resilience under varying image conditions introduced by brightness and contrast adjustments.\
\
In the examination of original images, YOLOv8 emerges with faster execution times, offering a compelling advantage for applications demanding rapid real-time processing. Conversely, YOLOv5 exhibits a consistent propensity for higher confidence scores, underscoring its potential in scenarios prioritizing precision over speed. The study critically evaluates the trade-off between speed and accuracy, recognizing its pivotal role in informing model selection based on specific project requirements.
Beyond the analysis of original images, the research extends to explore the adaptability of both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 to variations in image characteristics induced by adjustments in brightness and contrast. The findings reveal a nuanced impact on execution times and confidence scores, shedding light on the models' robustness in the face of diverse environmental conditions.\
\
Importantly, this research is contextualized within the specific domain of tank detection, emphasizing the need for nuanced evaluations tailored to distinct datasets and use cases. The insights garnered from this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the performance nuances between YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 on the Raspberry Pi, offering valuable considerations for real-world deployment in real-time object detection applications. The study sets the stage for future investigations aimed at optimizing these models for resource-constrained edge devices.
